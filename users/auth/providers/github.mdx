<Warning>Coming soon!</Warning>
<Note>You cannot use public emails like @gmail.com, @outlook.com, etc. Proven is enterprise focused, not consumer focused - therefore we want to validate your business domain directly.</Note>

You can use Proven's GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps) to create a user account with Proven. 

- [Global](https://console.proven.cloud/signin)
- [US](https://console.us.proven.cloud/signin)
- [EU (Coming Soon)](https://console.eu.proven.cloud/signin)

After sign in/up, you can see the `Proven Cloud` app inside GitHub's [Authorized OAuth Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/reviewing-your-authorized-oauth-apps).

### Proven GitHub Apps
When you sign in/up to Proven with our GitHub app, you are using Proven's dedicated GitHub OAuth app. This is not to be confused with our actual Proven GitHub app that handles Proven service interaction with your GitHub Org/Enterprise/Repository. 

We separate them because users may just want to sign in/up with GitHub but not install an app that has a lot of GitHub permissions by default.
