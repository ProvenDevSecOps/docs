<Note>You cannot use public emails like @gmail.com, @outlook.com, etc. Proven is enterprise focused, not consumer focused - therefore we want to validate your business domain directly.</Note>

You can use Google's [Sign in with Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/12849458?hl=en) product to create a user account with Proven. 

- [Global](https://console.proven.cloud/signin)
- [US](https://console.us.proven.cloud/signin)
- [EU (Coming Soon)](https://console.eu.proven.cloud/signin)

After sign in/up, you can see the `Proven Cloud` app inside the Sign in with Google [Third-party apps and services page](https://myaccount.google.com/connections).
