<Note>You cannot use public emails like @gmail.com, @outlook.com, etc. Proven is enterprise focused, not consumer focused - therefore we want to validate your business domain directly.</Note>

You can use Apple's [Sign in with Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102609) product to create a user account with Proven. 

- [Global](https://console.proven.cloud/signin)
- [US](https://console.us.proven.cloud/signin)
- [EU (Coming Soon)](https://console.eu.proven.cloud/signin)

After sign in/up, you can see the `Proven Cloud` app inside the Sign in with Apple [apps and websites section](https://account.apple.com/account/manage).

<Warning>You cannot use Apple's [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105078) feature at this time - see the callout above for why. If you signed up with Hide my Email enabled - [Turn Off Email Forwarding](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210426)</Warning>
