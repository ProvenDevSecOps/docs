As a user you can see your specific audit trail via the Audit Logs page:

- [Global](https://console.proven.cloud/user/security/logs)
- [US](https://console.us.proven.cloud/user/security/logs)
- [EU (Coming Soon)](https://console.eu.proven.cloud/user/security/logs)

You can download these logs via CSV or JSON directly in the Console. To export logs to a SIEM, use the [Org Audit Trail](/org/security/logs)
